1. Initialization:
    a. Define rank and number of processors
    b. Initialize blank velocities array (global)
    c. Define mass, position, velocity and force arrays for each processor
    d. MPI Initialize
2. Distrubte particles across processors and define master processor code
3. Allocate memory for all attributes of particles
4. Based on above allocated memory define a MPI custom data type for chunking of data for transmission
5. Process initial state on master processor
6. Broadcast particle data of each processor from master processor
7. Start simulation timer and repeat for target no of simulation cycles:
    a. Calculate net force on each particle due to all other particles
    b. Update position and velocities based on calculated force of each particle
    c. Receive updated position and velocities of all the particles on all processors (MPI_Allgather)
8. Process the final state of system and dump into file and stop simulation timer
9. Free all allocated memory and exit gracefully
